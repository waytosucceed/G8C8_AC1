            Today we have uncovered an unexpected page from this planet’s recorded history of
            scientific achievements. We have often heard about Albert Einstein's credo but today we
            unearthed the fact that a woman named Emmy Noether was behind Einstein's success
            and worldly reputation. In 1915, Noether was invited to the University of Göttingen to
            help Einstein with his theory of relativity and her solution proved that Energy is always
            conserved, though the conservation may require a sufficiently large expanse of space to
            actually work out. Living in a male-dominated world, she worked unpaid, but after this
            work the university hired her to give her paid work. In 1932, she was the first woman
            ever to give the keynote speech at the International Congress of Mathematicians. Of the
            420 mathematicians gathered, she was also the only woman in attendance. Later,
            because of the Jews-Nazis conflict she had to move from Germany to work in a women’s
            college in Pennsylvania. <br><br>
          
    
    
           <b>Overview of the Grammar topics:</b> <br>
    
           Linking verbs do not talk about actions. They tell us about <br>
           ● What people or things are <br>
           ● The existence of people and things <br>
           ● Describe people/things or add details about them. <br><br>







          <b><i> Be (the entire group)</i></b>,<b><i>Become</i></b> and <b><i>Seem</i></b> always act as Linking Verbs. <br>
          <b><i> Sensory verbs</i></b> can function as <b><i>Linking Verbs</i></b> only when they <b><i>describe the subject.</i></b> <br><br>
           Linking Verbs establish a link between subjects and subject complements.
           Subject complements are bifurcated into two types: <br>   <br>
          1) Predicate Nouns/Predicate Nominative(Single Nouns and Noun Phrases)    <br>                                                
          2) Predicate Adjective(Single adjectives and Adjective phrases)
